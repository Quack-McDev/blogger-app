This is my first full stack dev project.

It is a simple text blog app that saves, edits and deletes posts. I am 100% certain that I missed the idea of what a blog website is supposed to look like but I ended up trying my best to recreate twitter.
I am proud of the "add new post" button.

Requires node to run the server on the backend

By default the server is accessed through port 3000 in browser through the local host. (localhost:3000/).

The site uses text files to save posts (I am still working on using databases, might come back and implement that later).
